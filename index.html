            Hey, princess. I just want to say I'm really sorry for what
            happeened. I never meant to betray your trust or hurt you in any
            way. You mean the world to me and you deserve the world and more
            baby. I don't want to keep arguing princess. I want to make things
            right between us. Please forgive me. As always, I'll continue to be
            that shoulder you can lean on, the person that will be there for you
            no matter what. If the world was agaisnt you....it's you and I
            agaisnt the world baby. I love you from the top to the bottom of my
            heart, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make
            things right between us. I know just making a beautiful card like
            this won't magically fix everything, I just want you to know how
            truly sorry I am. Words arent enough to show how truly sorry I am, I
            want to show you through my actions. Thank you for taking time to
            read this princess, I hope things can better between us. I want what's best for you and us and I really do
            love you princess. Keep being the amazing person that you are.
          </p>
